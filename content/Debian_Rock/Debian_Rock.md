## Getting Started

Once you have managed to get into the Debain OS on the Rock C+, you will need to do a couple of steps to get the OS ready.

1. Update the system
    
     ~~~admonish terminal

     ```
     sudo apt update
     ```

     ~~~

    - This should update the system however you may get a response that says:
        ~~~admonish error

        ```sh
        > W: An error occured during the signature verifcation. The repository is not updated and the previous index files will be used. GPG error: http://apt.radxa/com/bullseye-stable bullseye InRelease: The following signatures could not be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY 9B98116C9AA302C7
        > W: Filed to fetch http://apt.radxa/com/bullseye-stable/dists/bullseye/InRelease The following signatures could not be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY 9B98116C9AA302C7
        > W: Some index files failed to download. They have been ignored, or old ones used instead.
        ```
        
        ~~~
    
    -  If that is the case you will need to run the following command:
    
        ~~~admonish terminal

        ```sh
        $ wget -O - apt.radxa.com/focal-stable/public.key | sudo apt-key add
        ```
        
        ~~~
    
    - You should get some feedback with a HTTP request and a Warning about apt-key is deprecated... this is fine (if only there was a deterministic, declarative system out there we could have used...)

    - Run the `sudo apt update` again and once finished run `sudo apt upgrade` this my take 10 mins.

## Networking

The Debain OS for the Rock C4+ uses the `NetworkManager` package to manage all connections to the network interface chips. 

`NetworkManager` directory is located here -> `/etc/NetworkManager`, the contents of which is:

~~~admonish terminal 

```sh
NetworkManager.conf
conf.d/
dispatcher.d/
dnsmasq-shared.d/
dnsmasq.d/
system-connections/
```

~~~

All of your Wi-Fi profiles are stored in the `system-connections` folder, for example:

~~~admonish terminal

```sh
$ ls /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections
> OKdo05.nmconnection
> eduroam.nmconnection
```

~~~

~~~admonish important

The file naming convention, `<ssid>.nmconnection`, this is strict and case-sensitive.

~~~

Each `...nmconnection` file has a format and for eduroam, which is an enterprise network it looks like this, you will need to have root level permissions:

~~~admonish terminal

```sh
$ sudo cat /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/eduroam.nmconnection
```
~~~

~~~admonish output

```sh
[connection]

You may need to reload the connection:
- `nmcli connection reload` or you can do this with elevation
- `sudo ncmli connetion reload`
